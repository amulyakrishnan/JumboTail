    1. Dockerfile for Jenkins Agent
    2. AWS Infrastructure Architecture

1. Building the Jenkins Agent Docker Image

We have created a Dockerfile for a Jenkins agent that is capable of building Java applications and comes preinstalled with Helm, AWS CLI, and Maven. Here's how you can build the Docker image:

docker build -t jenkins-agent:latest .

The Dockerfile (Dockerfile) is included in the project root directory.


2. Designing AWS Infrastructure

In this project AWS infrastructure is designed to host a frontend, backend, and database server. This is a simplified architecture, and in practice, we may need to adapt it to specific requirements. Here is an overview of the architecture:

    Frontend:
        Hosted on Amazon S3.
        Accelerated by Amazon CloudFront.
        Secured using AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM).

    Backend:
        Deployed on Amazon Elastic Container Service (ECS) or AWS Lambda.
        Managed through Amazon API Gateway.
        Secured with IAM roles and Lambda authorizers (for Lambda).

    Database Server:
        Relational database using Amazon RDS or NoSQL database using Amazon DynamoDB.
        Secured within a Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) with security groups and network ACLs.

    Other services:
        Amazon Route 53 for DNS management.
        AWS Key Management Service (KMS) for data encryption.
        AWS CloudWatch for monitoring and logging.
        Auto Scaling and Elastic Load Balancing for high availability.

Actual architecture should be tailored to project's specific requirements and constraints. It's important to consider security, cost optimization, and scalability when designing it.
